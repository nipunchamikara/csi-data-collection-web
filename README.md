# CSI Data Collection and Labelling

This project consists of two main components:

- [React-based web application](./frontend/README.md) for sending data collection requests to a FastAPI service and displaying the progress of the data collection process.
- [FastAPI-based service](./backend/README.md) for collecting data from an ESP32 device connected to a serial port and storing it in CSV files.
